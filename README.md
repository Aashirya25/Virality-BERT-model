Sentiment vs engagement analysis on BBC News Instagram posts - BERT sentiment classifier
# BBC Instagram Virality BERT model
This project analyzes whether sentiment (positive vs. negative) affects engagement/virality on BBC News Instagram posts using hypothesis tests and an SEIR-style spread model. It also includes a BERT-based sentiment classifier adapted from an educational winter camp template and retrained on my dataset.

## Files
- Virality_BERT.ipynb — training/evaluation + inference demo
- virality_train.csv / virality_test.csv — labeled dataset splits

## Quick Start
1. Open the file in Google Colab
2. Runtime → Run all
3. Outputs include confusion matrix, word clouds + sample predictions

This BERT notebook structure was adapted from a winter ML & NLP camp template; I integrated my own dataset, labels, preprocessing, training/evaluation, and analysis.
